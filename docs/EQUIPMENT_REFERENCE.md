# Equipment Reference - Kingston Dry Dock Pump Room

Historical and technical reference for the pump room equipment, based on the 1896 Perley engineering report and Donald Page's documentation.

## Pumping System Overview

**Designed by**: Logan and Rankin, Consulting Engineers, Toronto  
**Built by**: John Inglis Co., Toronto  
**Completed**: 1892  
**Capacity**: 2,100,000 gallons emptied in 75 minutes

## Main Centrifugal Pumps (2)

Two identical vertical 18-inch centrifugal pumps:

- **Disc diameter**: 4 feet 8 inches
- **Configuration**: One right-handed, one left-handed
- **Location**: Deep well, floor level with dry dock bottom
- **Suction pipes**: 22 inches diameter, with foot-valves
- **Discharge pipes**: 22 inches diameter
- **Discharge level**: 9 feet below coping (2'6" below zero)
- **Capacity**: 14,000 gallons per minute each
- **Operating speed**: 175 RPM
- **Color coding**: Green (as visible today)

## Main Steam Engines (2)

Two vertical, high-pressure steam engines:

- **Cylinder diameter**: 18 inches
- **Stroke**: 18 inches
- **Operating speed**: 175 RPM
- **Configuration**: Directly coupled to pumps, in line
- **Clutch system**: Either engine can drive both pumps, or opposite pump
- **Color coding**: Red/brown with brass fittings

## Auxiliary System

### Auxiliary Pump
- **Type**: 8-inch horizontal centrifugal
- **Maximum lift**: 31 feet 6 inches
- **Discharge level**: 3 feet below zero
- **Purpose**: Arterial drains, leakage collection, backup

### Auxiliary Engines
- **Type**: Paired vertical, high-pressure
- **Cylinder diameter**: 12 inches
- **Stroke**: 12 inches
- **Additional function**: Operates caisson moving mechanism via intermediate gearing

## Boiler Plant (Original 1892)

Four H.R.T. (Horizontal Return Tubular) boilers:

- **Length**: 14 feet
- **Diameter**: 5.5 feet
- **Tubes**: 8.5 No. 9 W.G. lap-welded charcoal iron, 3.5" external diameter
- **Dome**: 3 feet high, 2.5 feet diameter
- **Shell and ends**: 3/8" steel
- **Working pressure**: 100 PSI
- **Test pressure**: 180 PSI cold water
- **Note**: Two boilers sufficient for main engines

### 1938 Upgrade
Three larger H.R.T. boilers with automatic stokers replaced the original four.

## Later Additions

### Warm Water Tank (c. 1940)
- **Purpose**: Store heated effluent from air compressors
- **Use**: De-icing ships during winter drydocking
- **Color coding**: Blue (as visible today)

### Air Compressor (WWII era)
- **Manufacturer**: Ingersoll-Rand
- **Capacity**: 2,500 CFM
- **Location**: Former dynamo room
- **Note**: Replaced inadequate steam-driven Chicago Pneumatic unit

## Color Coding Scheme

The visible color scheme in the pump room today:

| Color | System | Examples |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Green** | Pumps | Main centrifugal pumps, pump bodies |
| **Red** | Steam | Steam supply lines, engine components |
| **Yellow** | Discharge | Water discharge pipes |
| **Blue** | Water storage | Warm water tank |
| **White/Cream** | Structure | Walls, building elements |

## Key Personnel

**W. Geoghan** - Chief Engineer  
- Present at first pump operation (1890)
- Served until 1950 (60 years)
- Witnessed Sir John A. Macdonald's cornerstone ceremony

## Technical Notes from Perley Report

> "The major portion of the floor of the engine room is 6.5 ft. below zero, or 13 ft. below coping level, and on it is placed the pumping plant..."

> "By means of clutches they can be geared together so that one engine can drive both pumps, or an engine can drive the opposite pump."

> "The dock at zero contains 2,100,000 gallons of water when unoccupied by a vessel, and can then be emptied in 75 minutes, the pumps and engines making 175 revolutions per minute, each pump thus throwing 14,000 per minute."
